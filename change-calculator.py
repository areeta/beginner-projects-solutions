# Change Calculator

# Imagine that your friend is a cashier, but has a hard time
    # counting back change to customers.
# Create a program that allows him to input a certain amount of
# change, and then print how how many quarters, dimes, nickels,
# and pennies are needed to make up the amount needed.
# Example: if he inputs 1.47, the program will say that he needs
    # 5 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, and 2 pennies.

# Subgoals:
    # So your friend doesnâ€™t have to calculate how much change is needed,
        # allow him to type in the amount of money given to him and the price
        # of the item. The program should then tell him the amount of each
        # coin he needs like usual.
    # To make the program even easier to use, loop the program back to the top
        # so your friend can continue to use the program without having to close
        # and open it every time he needs to count change.
